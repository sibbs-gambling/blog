Various quotes I've come across that are particularly good.

>All too many of those who live in affluent America ignore those who exist in poor America. In doing so, the affluent Americans will eventually have to face themselves with the question that Eichmann chose to ignore: How responsible am I for the well-being of my fellows? To ignore evil is to become an accomplice to it.
\\
<cite>__Martin Luther King Jr.__ in his 1967 book Where Do We Go from Here: Chaos or Community?

<p>

>I shall stand by the Union with absolute disregard of personal consequences. What are personal consequences in comparison with the good or evil which may befall a great country in a crisis like this? Let the consequences be what they will, I am careless. No man can suffer too much, and no man can fall too soon, if he suffer or if he fall in defense of the liberties and Constitution of his country.
\\
<cite>__Daniel Webster__</cite>, Senator from Massachusetts, in his final Senate speech on July 17, 1850. He gave an impassioned speech in defense of the Union.

<p>

>If [a Senator] allows himself to be governed by the opinions of his friends at home, however devoted he may be to them or they to him, he throws away all the rich results of a previous preparation and study, and simply becomes a commonplace exponent of those popular sentiments which may change in a few days. Such a course will dwarf any man’s statesmanship and his vote would be simply considered as an echo of current opinion, not the result of mature deliberations.
\\
<cite>__Lucius Lamar__, Senator from Mississippi.</cite>

<p>

>Gentlemen of the Jury - I am for the prisoners at the bar; and shall apologize for it only in the words of the Marquis Beccaria: "If I can but be the instrument of preserving one life, his blessings and tears shall be sufficient consolation to me for the contempt of mankind!"
\\
<cite>__John Adams__ on defending the British Regulars who were accused in the trial following the Boston Massacre.</cite>

<p>

>For democracy means much more than popular government and majority rule, much more than a system of political techniques to flatter or deceive powerful blocs of voters. A democracy that has no George Norris to point to—no monument of individual conscience in a sea of popular rule—is not worthy to bear the name. The true democracy, living and growing and inspiring, puts its faith in the people—faith that the people will not simply elect men who will represent their views ably and faithfully, but also elect men who will exercise their conscientious judgment—faith that the people will not condemn those whose devotion to principle leads them to unpopular courses, but will reward courage, respect honor and ultimately recognize right.
\\
<cite>__John F. Kennedy__ on democracy.</cite>

<p>

>Revolutions are made to establish the rights of man. Therefore, in the interests of these rights, it is necessary to take all measures required for the success of such revolutions. The revolutionary interest might require the repression of a conspiracy founded on the liberty of the press. I declare that laws expressly made for the Revolution are necessary, even if they are contrary to the freedom of the press.
\\
<cite>__Maximilien Robespierre__ on "freedom" of the press during the early stages of The Terror in
the French Revolution.</cite>
