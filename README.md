This is the __content__ repo for my hugo-powered blog. The static site
files (e.g. html/css/xml files) are stored in a separate repo so they can
be displayed on github pages (see URL below).

The static site files (i.e. docs/ in a standard hugo directory) are in the repo
[here](https://github.com/sibbs-gambling/sibbs-gambling.github.io).

To see the actual blog site on github pages go to: https://sibbs-gambling.github.io/
